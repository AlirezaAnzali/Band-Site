# Band-Site

This is the Band-Site project created by me for BrainStation software engineering boot camp using basic HTML, SASS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and APIs.

This project was completed over a period of three weeks, with each week corresponding to a separate sprint.

- Sprint 1 focused on setting up the user interface (UI) of the site.
- Sprint 2 allowed for the creation of new comments, retrieval of hard-coded existing comments, and display of both the new and existing comments on the page.
- Sprint 3 involved maintaining the comments in an API instead of using hard-coded comments.

This repository contains the final product as it was submitted.

## Features
The project has the following features:

- It pulls data from Heroku using Axios
- It uses JS DOM to create a comment section and display the pulled data
- Posting comments will automatically update the page with the new comment.
